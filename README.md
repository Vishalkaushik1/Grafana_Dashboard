## **Data Ingestion Process**

The data ingestion process was carefully designed to handle the large dataset and transform it into a time-series format suitable for **InfluxDB**. Below are the steps in detail:

### **Step 1: Data Preprocessing**
1. **Header Standardization:**  
   - Column names were cleaned and converted to lowercase without spaces (e.g., `Rainfall_mm` → `rainfall_mm`).
2. **Feature Categorization:**  
   - Numerical Features: *rainfall_mm, temperature_Celsius, days_to_harvest, yield_tons_per_hectare*.
   - Categorical Features: *region, soil_type, crop, weather_condition*.
   - Boolean Features: *fertilizer_used, irrigation_used*.
3. **Datetime Formatting:**  
   - Timestamps were generated for every row to align the dataset with InfluxDB's time-series requirements.

### **Step 2: Transformation to Line Protocol**
InfluxDB requires data in a specific format called **line protocol**. A Python script (`convertToinflux.py`) was used to:
- Convert each row into the format:  
  ```
  measurement,tag_key=tag_value field_key=field_value timestamp
  ```
  Example:  
  ```
  agriculture_data,region=North,crop=Wheat rainfall_mm=200,temperature_Celsius=27 1693545600
  ```
- This transformation ensured that numerical values were stored as fields, while categorical values were stored as tags.

### **Step 3: Loading into InfluxDB**
1. **Telegraf Configuration:**
   - Telegraf was configured to read the transformed data file.
   - A custom configuration file (`telegraf.conf`) defined the input and output plugins.
2. **Data Validation:**
   - After ingestion, sample queries were run in InfluxDB to verify the data integrity.
